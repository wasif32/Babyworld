2. Plan the Game Mechanics
Core Features:

Air Pump Mechanism: Add a button that increases the balloon size when clicked.
Flying Effect: When fully inflated, the balloon should start moving randomly in different directions.
Burst on Tap: Allow the player to click/tap on the balloon to burst it.

Phaser.js: A popular HTML5 game framework with built-in support for physics, animations, and interactions.

 Steps to Implement
a. Air Pump Mechanism
Add a button for pumping air.
Increase the balloon size incrementally with each button press.
Set a size threshold for when the balloon is "fully inflated."
b. Balloon Flying Animation
Use CSS animations or JavaScript setInterval/requestAnimationFrame to move the balloon in random directions once inflated.
c. Burst on Tap
Add an event listener to the balloon for the click event.
Replace the balloon graphic with a "burst" graphic and play a sound effect (if provided).
Optionally, remove the balloon from the screen after bursting.
d. Graphics Integration
Use the provided assets for the balloon, air pump, and burst animation.
If needed, create additional graphics or use online free assets.
e. Game Over/Restart Mechanism (Optional)
Display a message when the balloon bursts.
Provide a reset button to restart the game.

raphics Editor: Use Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma if you need to tweak any assets.
Sound Effects: Add fun popping sound effects (e.g., from freesound.org).
Hosting (Optional): Deploy the game prototype on GitHub Pages or Netlify for easy sharing.

7. Time Management
Day 1: Implement air pump, balloon inflation, and movement mechanics.
Day 2: Add the burst functionality, polish graphics, test, and package for submission.
